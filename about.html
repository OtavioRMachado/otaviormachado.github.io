<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a generalist Software Engineer. I started my career as a Java developer but learnt Ruby and other languages along the way. Now I am language-agnostic! I am currently working at ThoughtWorks inc. as a Consultant Developer, helping not only to solve our client's problems, but to develop the whole team in the process.</p>

<p>I like to see myself as someone deeply involved with the business, someone who tries to understand what is the big picture, the problem we are trying to solve and the context around it, so the team can walk in the direction of the best solution possible for that problem.</p>

<p>I am also really interested in challenging problems – problems that make me go that extra mile – that take me out of my comfort zone; I feel those are the experiences where I learn the most, so usually when there is a fire, I am the one not running away from it, but running in its direction.</p>

<p>As a problem solver, I am a very big fan of Data Science. I feel that understanding data and being able to get more information than the eyes can see with it – and also solving complex problems using a computer – are the future of Software. I worked a little bit on Machine Learning during college and I use my spare time to research more about it. I am also all about diversity.</p>

<p>I am myself a member of the LGBTQ community and I feel that the most diverse a team is, the most diverse and creative the solution we end up reaching is, as well. At ThoughtWorks, I had the opportunity to create the Gender and Sexuality Minorities group and to be a Technical Coach for people who still were not ready to be Software Engineers.</p>

<p>As you can probably notice, english is not my native language. If you see something written wrong, please don't hesitate on contacting me. :)</p>
