Hello, World!

I'm Otavio, a Software Developer from Porto Alegre, Brazil. I've just started my learning journey in the world of code, and I have a pile of books, articles and documentation to read.

When I start learning something, one of my main concerns is whether I really learned it or if in one week from now I will forget about it. Being able to write a post on a subject I'm starting to understand will help me not only learn in more detail, but also have a place where I can resume what I have understood and discuss with more people that are interested in the same subject. 

I always say I learn a lot better when I have a conversation about a subject than reading a book for hours. This is a place to join both experiences. :)

My main intention is having a place to write on technology related stuff that comes to my attention. Being able to share some knowledge with other is a plus. Create positive discussions on topics is also a plus.

If you got here because of one of my posts, thank you for coming and I hope one of my posts can help you in any way. If there's something you read that is not clear enough, please don't hesitate on sending me an e-mail. I'm a very open guy and all feedback is welcome. 

I hope I see you soon. :)
