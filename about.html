<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm Otavio, a 23 years old Software Developer from Porto Alegre, a city in southern Brazil. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UFSM (2014), but the main thing I learned in the University is how big is the world of IT and how much I still have to learn everyday in order to understand most of what is going on in this fast-changing subject.</p>
<p>When it comes to code, my main interests currently involve <b>coding best practices</b>, <b>testing</b>, <b>design patterns</b> and <b>agile methodologies</b>, but they are always changing and I can pretty much say that I'm interested in everything about IT.</p>
<p>Currently, I am a Consultant Developer at ThoughtWorks Brazil.</p>

<p>But life is not always about coding, right?</p>
<p>Being a gay guy, I'm very passionate about the LGBTQI cause and I try being active on it. I also empathize with the gender equality, black and other minorities causes.</p>
<p>I love traveling. I've already visited more than 30 countries and I really enjoy discovering new cultures and new customs.</p>
<p>In my free time, I also play computer games, like <b>League of Legends</b> and <b>Hearthstone</b>.</p>

<p>As you can probably notice, english is not my native language. If you see something written wrong, please don't hesitate on contacting me. :)</p>
